         <p id="#testP">A massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) is a video game that combines aspects of a role-playing video game and a massively multiplayer online game.
            As in role-playing games (RPGs), the player assumes the role of a character (often in a fantasy world or science-fiction world) and takes control over many of that character's actions. 
            MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by the number of players able to interact together, 
            and by the game's persistent world (usually hosted by the game's publisher), which continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away from the game.

               <figcaption>MapleStory (Korean: 메이플스토리; RR: Meipeul Seutori) is a free-to-play, 2D, side-scrolling massively multiplayer online role-playing game, 
                  developed by South Korean company Wizet. Several versions of the game are available for specific countries or regions, 
                  published by various companies (such as Nexon).</i> </figcaption>
                  <p>My <i>first</i> MMORPG. When I was a kid my family didn't own a gaming PC, so I resorted to playing more low intensive games. Before Maplestory I played
                     a countless amount of free-to-play(F2P) MMORPGs that were usually less graphically intensive than things like World of Warcraft. I liked Maplestory due to the 
                     cute anime like visuals and side scrolling combat. The social aspect of Maplestory was my favorite aspect, as most people playing the game were anime fans and around 
                     my age. Though I didn't achieve much in MS, I did have a lot of fun hanging around with other players in the main and high level towns.
                     A few notable examples of other F2P games I played around this time were Runescape, Silkroad, and Rakion. </p>

               <p>Finally, a <i>true</i> MMORPG experience. Around the age of 12 my parents let me go with them to pick out our new family computer. I made sure it'd meet the 
               system requirements to run World of Warcraft. Around this time the first 'Expansion' for the game was released, named "The Burning Crusade." I played this game 
               so much that my parents began to worry about me, regardless, I managed to make it to the highest level and even ran a guild (Guilds are a MMORPG mainstay, they're
               basically a ingame group of players, like a club.) that completed endgame content.</p>

               <figcaption><i>Aion: The Tower of Eternity (Korean: 아이온: 영원의 탑) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by the South Korean company NCSoft. 
                  The game combines PvP and PvE (a concept the developers call PvPvE) in a fantasy game environment. As of May 20, 2009, Aion had 3.5 million subscribers in Asia</i></figcaption>
                  <p>As I got farther into World of Warcraft, I ended up not enjoying how the game had been progressing, and found myself resorting back to Korean made MMORPGs. Aion was a game 
                     that was made by the same company who created Maplestory, however, it was a fully 3D MMORPG with impressive graphics. Alongside that, it also boasted a impressive 
                     flying mechanic in which all players were able to grow wings and take flight throughout the world. Aion focused more on 'Player Versus Player' content, which was my favorite
                     content in World of Warcraft. I eventually became proficient at the flight based PvP and would consistently compete in server wide battles with my guild, which was my first
                     queer group of friends I had and maintained. I'm still friends with some of them outside of the game. </p>

                        <p>While playing World of Warcraft, I was curious to see how a MMORPG would play on a console versus a PC. I had played the demo for Phantasy Star Universe, and eventually convinced
               my mom to buy it for me when I was in middle school. I was still playing World of Warcraft, but the MMORPG infection had spread so far I couldn't help myself. PSU was made by one
               of my favorite game companies, <b>Sega's Sonic Team.</b> The gameplay was different from World of Warcraft and Aion, featuring more of an arcade like, action based combat system. 
               The world wasn't open ended like WoW or Aion though, as it featured 'instance based' (players enter a combat field alone or with a party) style of MMORPG, where in town you see players
               running about and enjoying the game, however, once you left the town for the combat field you're on your own unless you brought a party with you. I still play this game today! </p>

                  <p> Finally, we're caught up to present day. I've played this game for over 5 years consistently now, and can confidently say it is my favorite MMORPG of all time. It being from 
                     one of my favorite series of games, <b>Final Fantasy</b> doesn't hurt either. There's too many accomplishments to count for FFXIV, however, I will say that I've completed almost
                     <i>all</i> of the content the game has to offer. Everything I've done or exceled at in previous MMORPGs I've done the same here. Whether it's running a guild with my friends,
                     competing in PvP, running endgame raids, or hanging out with my girlfriend (pictured), I've done all of that in more in the world of Eorzea.  </p>
